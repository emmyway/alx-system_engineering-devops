For every additional element, explain why you are adding it
What are firewalls for
Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
What monitoring is used for
How the monitoring tool is collecting data
Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS
explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem

THE SPECIFICS OF ADDING THESE NEW ELEMENTS:
#1 SSL Certificate for HTTPS - To encrypt the data transmitted between the server and the client, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
#3 Monitoring Clients - To collect and analyze performance metrics, logs, and other data for proactive monitoring and troubleshooting.

Firewalls
  Firewalls are added to control and monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules. They help protect the infrastructure from unauthorized access, malicious attacks, and other security threats.


Traffic Served over HTTPS:
  Serving traffic over HTTPS encrypts the data exchanged between the server and the client, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential and secure.

How Monitoring collect data:
  The monitoring tool collects data by deploying monitoring clients (e.g., agents or collectors) on the servers. These clients gather metrics, logs, and other relevant information and transmit them to the monitoring platform for analysis and visualization.

what to do if Monitoring Web Server QPS:
To monitor the web server's QPS (Queries Per Second), I would configure the monitoring tool to track the number of HTTP requests received by the web server within a specific time interval. This can be done by analyzing web server access logs or using built-in monitoring features provided by web server software.

Issues with this Infrastructure:
#Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer Level: 1.Terminating SSL at the load balancer level means that the decrypted traffic is forwarded to the backend servers. This exposes the data to potential risks if the communication between the load balancer and the servers is not secure. 2.The load balancer will be overloaded with more complexity of the decripting task. 3.potential single point of failure if the load balancer security is breached that is all; there is free access to confidential contents.
#Single MySQL Server for Writes: Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes introduces a single point of failure for write operations. If this server fails or experiences issues, it can lead to data loss, downtime, and service interruptions.
#Uniformity of Server Components: vulnerability to common failure modes affecting all servers simultaneously.
